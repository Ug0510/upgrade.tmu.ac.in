The recruiter expects to see depth of understanding, analytical skills and originality in student responses, whether it be G.D. or Personal Interview. Needless to add that a good CGPA and proficiency in some extracurricular activity such as active club participation will be a very valuable add on for the student, which can be acquired through hard work, extensive reading, especially of financial and general news papers besides study of the course curriculum and last but not least, by regularly attending the class lectures, guest lectures, workshops and seminars organized by University.
