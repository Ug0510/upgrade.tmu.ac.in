                    Today I feel honored to serve as the Principal of this prestigious institute Teerthanker Mahaveer Medical College & Research Centre, which was established in 2008 with the entry of only 100 students for MBBS which was increased within a very short time to 150 students during the year 2014-15. The ladder of success has been constant and rather very fast for the Post Graduate seats also. There are 126 Post Graduate seats in different Pre, Para & Clinical subjects.<br>I have been given opportunities to sharpen my skills and knowledge to excel as a facilitator and a good organizer. It is now my turn to motivate faculty members to impart Knowledge and practical skills to students in becoming a perfect doctor.<br>The two qualities also needed to pursue graduation and post graduation in any branch of Medicine to serve the society is to have sympathy and empathy for patients and their relatives.<br>My message to all staff and students is to have love and respect for all, move forward with purpose and passion.<br>Medicos should never forget society has great expectation from them. <br> Respect, care, discipline and punctuality are the mandatory qualities to enhance not only our image but also to transform our institute into a centre of excellence.
