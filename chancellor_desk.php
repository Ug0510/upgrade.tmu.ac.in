                                        It is my firm belief that harmonious development of the society can be achieved by <span class="highlight">enlightenment of the individual heart, mind and soul</span>. This has become a prerequisite in today’s fast changing world where material gains have out-placed basic human values. I am of the firm opinion that education as a powerful instrument of socio-economic change can transform the attitude, thinking and life style of the people and society. <span class="highlight">Education enables flexible thinking and better decision making capabilities in individuals</span>.<br>
                                        I have always dreamt of empowering the society with enlightened, skillful and socially relevant citizens, which can be possible only by educating the masses. As such, we initiated in this benign task of reconstructing the social order by providing educational establishments, thus contributing to the development of nation in our own humble way. <span class="highlight">Teerthanker Mahaveer University has taken the task of developing human capital in tune with the requirements of industry and the society</span> by integrating the basic principles of Right Philosophy, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct in its policies and programmes.<br>
                                        The University stands for humanism, tolerance, reason, adventure of ideas and the search of truth. We ensure that multitude of students study in a tolerant but encouraging environment that provides adequate liberty for individual ambition and lifestyle.
