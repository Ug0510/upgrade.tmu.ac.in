								<p>The examination system is based on a continuous evaluation of the students performance on different parameters. Most of the programmes of the University are based on semester system except wherever the University authorities and statutory bodies decide otherwise. The continuous evaluation is both internal and external. While the internal evaluation comprises of two internal mid semester examinations, projects, assignments, tutorials and attendance, the end semester examination is fully external for ensuring fair assessment of the students competence.</p>
