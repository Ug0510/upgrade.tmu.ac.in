                    It gives me great pleasure to see, the college make a prominent mark in the field of art education and my students growing aesthetically, intellectually, culturally, and spiritually. Our results have been extremely encouraging, and our students are placed in a variety of esteemed creative fields in the industry, like Advertising, Art Direction, Interface Design, E-learning, Web Design, Exhibition Design, Product Design, Merchandising, Branding, Motion Graphics, Photography, Profession Artist , Teaching in Art Profession etc.<br>Many of our students pursue higher education, and get admitted in internationally acclaimed design institutions in India as well as abroad. This shows the commitment of our staff as well as students towards imparting international education to provide global career for our students.<br>I hope as HoD to continue to grow such excellence, and I appreciate guidance of our management and participation of staff and students in the endeavor towards excellence.<br>As HoD I am very proud of the College achievements and I am absolutely confident that at TMU College of Fine Arts we not only educate every student, but cater for individual needs and a highly sustainable future, thus ensuring good citizens of India.
