                    <br><br>Every day, we see lawyers make a real difference in people's lives. Our community looks up to legal professionals to solve complex issues they face. In the College of Law and Legal Studies, we prepare practice-ready advocates to fulfill the responsibilities that their prospective clients entrust them. Since the inception of the CLLS, we have always found new ways to teach legal education and research. The country has a booming legal market with a lot of potential for future lawyers, as 20% of the world's lawyers are Indian. The breadth of opportunities for future lawyers has never been greater. So, law colleges are facing a sea change in their educational responsibilities. Legal education is crucial now, and CLLS is innovating to address the changes that have evolved over the years. I welcome you to the College of Law and Legal Studies and invite you to explore all aspects of our intellectual life.
