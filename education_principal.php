                    The teaching fraternity plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of the nation. The stalwart educators of yesteryears have been apostles of knowledge and self-discipline. Their commitment to excellence has set outstanding standards of education, reflected through a series of knowledge embedded with values. As the best education college in UP and top in India, we offer programmes in B.Ed., B.Sc.-B.Ed., B.A.-B.Ed., B.El.Ed., M.Ed., and Ph.D. The arrival of smart technology and internet access for young minds has not only shrunk the world but also opened new vistas for the teaching and learning process. Students have become more inquisitive and oriented toward learning. They need to be encouraged to carry out independent learning while pursuing the ideas conceived in their young minds. In this new scenario, teachers must update their knowledge and stay abreast of the latest developments.<br>The new scenario demands that teachers should also update their knowledge and follow latest techniques in teaching methodology to equip students with new skills so as to judge the reliability of information received from new resources.<br>The teacherâ€™s role has changed from educators to facilitators. They have to adjust their lesson plan strategy to take account of interactive nature of new technology. The focus of teaching learning process is to provide insight and learning support to the students both from inside and outside the classroom environment.
