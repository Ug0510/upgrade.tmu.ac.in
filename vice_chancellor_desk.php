                                    The statement<span class="highlight">"your future will be decided by what you do today" </span>is so apt for everyone joining TMU. Your destiny will be shaped by what you do during the years you are with us. It's important to differentiate between earning a degree & learning. The academic processes of TMU are tailored to learning and skill development. Many years ago Albert Einstein said <span class="highlight">"the purpose of education is to develop thinking"</span> and similarly Herbert Simon stated,<span class="highlight"> "learning occurs from what the student does & thinks"</span>.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The biggest challenge for both, institutions and students is to take a detour from the traditional approach of <span class="highlight">rote learning & written examination</span> which emphasized, for too long, <span class="highlight">recall & memorization</span>, this approach stifled well-structured & creativity in universities. For decades, we have been functioning in classrooms like a trans-receiver system and evaluating students through "<span class="highlight">direct & single correct answer</span>" questions which never tested learning & thinking. It was a test of memory.<br>

                                </p>
