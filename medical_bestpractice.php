                            <p class="mb-3">A mentor is a person who has professional & life experience and who voluntarily agrees to help a mentee to develop skills, competencies or goals. A mentor is an advisor who is willing to invest in the mentee’s personal growth and professional development.</p>
                            <p class="mb-3">The purpose of the mentorship programme is twofold. It intends both to create a good environment for studying in the department and to develop knowledge of the subject for all involved. The mentorship programme is intended to enhance the quality of your education.</p>
                            <p class="mb-3">There is mentor-mentee system for M.B.B.S & M.Sc. students (Undergraduates & Postgraduates). The system is updated time to time. 150 M.B.B.S students are divided into group of 25 each per session. Each group of 25 students is under a respective faculty (allotted by Head of department) of that session.</p>
                            <p class="mb-3">Each allotted faculty takes care of 25 students, asks questions about their problems, difficulty in studies or other personal issues. The mentor handbooks are updated timely and grievances/complaints of students are noted and tried to be sort out and informed to the concerned authority.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">At the end of each session mentor – mentee handbooks are handed over to the co-ordinator mentor – mentee program after duly signed by HOD and Principal. The co-ordinator checks all the essentials, ensures that student’s grievances are met and transfers the mentor – mentee handbooks to the next allotted faculties. The whole data is filed in a format present with the co-ordinator and record is maintained. Periodic meetings are held among mentor-mentee and between mentors and co-ordinator for smooth functioning of the program.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">The Institution has a well-defined feedback system in place with a 360 degree approach that covers all stake holders in the system.</p>
