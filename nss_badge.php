                <p class="mb-3">The symbol for the NSS has been based on the giant Rath Wheel of the world famous Konark Sun Temple (The Black Pagoda) situated in Orissa, India. The wheel portrays the cycle of creation, preservation and release and signifies the movement in life across time and space, the symbol thus stands for continuity as well as change and implies the continuous striving of NSS for social change.</p>

                <p>The NSS symbol is embossed on the NSS badge. The NSS volunteers wear it while undertaking any programme of community service. The Konark wheel in the symbol has eight bars which represent the 24 hours of the day. The Red colour in the badge indicates that the NSS volunteers are full of blood. i.e. lively, active energetic and full of high spirit. The Navy Blue colour indicates the cosmos of which the NSS is a tiny part, ready to contribute its share for the welfare of mankind.</p>
