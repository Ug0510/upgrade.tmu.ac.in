                    I feel a sense of great pride and accomplishment in holding the onerous office of the Medical Superintendent of Teerthanker Mahaveer Medical College & Research Centre.<br>Our hospital was established in the year 2008 with just 520 beds which have expanded to one thousand today. Progressing at a phenomenal pace, we boast of ultramodern, Modular Operation Theatres, Intensive Care Units, Private and General Wards besides other conveniences. We claim to have the best in line MRI, C.T. D.S.A., Mammography machines and offer the facility of a wide range of pathological investigations and a highly equipped Blood Bank.<br>The true gauge of our progress is the numbers of satisfied patients visiting our hospital. Our team of dedicated and competent doctors treat up to 2000 patients in the O.P.D. everyday with an I.P.D. occupancy of 500 to 700 patients and 30-40 operations are performed daily.<br>Our hospital also offers superlative super-specialty services in, Neurology, Gastroenterology, Urology, Plastic Surgery, Cardiology (equipped with a modular Cath. Lab) and Cardio-vascular Surgery.<br>It would not be an exaggeration to proclaim that all specialized and super-specialty services being provided are of very high quality at a very reasonable cost. We have never wavered from our mission of providing excellent health care at affordable prices to the ailing humanity and God willing, we shall collectively work to take this hospital to greater heights.
