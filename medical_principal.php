                                    "Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high, where knowledge is free. Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls. Where words come out from the depth of truth, where tireless striving stretches its arms toward perfection. Where the clear stream of reason has not lost it's way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit. Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever widening thought and action. In to that heaven of freedom, my father, LET MY COUNTRY AWAKE!"

                                <p class="mb-2">Today I feel honored to serve as the Principal of this prestigious institute Teerthanker Mahaveer Medical College & Research Centre, which was established in 2008 with the entry of only 100 students for MBBS which was increased within a very short time to 150 students during the year 2014-15. The ladder of success has been constant and rather very fast for the Post Graduate seats also. There are 126 Post Graduate seats in different Pre, Para & Clinical subjects.</p>
                                <p class="mb-2">I have been given opportunities to sharpen my skills and knowledge to excel as a facilitator and a good organizer. It is now my turn to motivate faculty members to impart Knowledge and practical skills to students in becoming a perfect doctor.</p>
                                <p class="mb-2">The two qualities also needed to pursue graduation and post graduation in any branch of Medicine to serve the society is to have sympathy and empathy for patients and their relatives.</p>
                                <p class="mb-3"> My message to all staff and students is to have love and respect for all, move forward with purpose and passion.</p>
