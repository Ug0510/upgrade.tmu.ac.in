    <p>In order to promote a responsive and conducive academic environment on the campus, each College/Independent Teaching Department shall establish a 'Students' Grievance Redressal Cell'.
      The ‘Cell’ shall provide a friendly mechanism to the students to report their grievances and the faster disposal of the same. It shall also provide a platform to the students to come forward with constructive suggestions for more efficient and effective teaching-learning atmosphere</p>
    <p>Further, the University has established a Students' Help Desk at the Administrative Block with an objective of guiding the university students to the appropriate Office/Officer for addressing their queries or resolving a difficulty. The ‘Help Desk’ shall also advise the students about the procedure involved in the matter.
      It may also facilitate in resolving any grievance of a student remaining unattended at the College/Department level.</p>

    <p>[<strong style="color:#001055; text-transform:capitalize; font-size:1vmax;">NOTE:</strong> The term “Grievance” refers to a difficulty, problem, or a feeling of discontent at individual student level due to an act/omission of the staff of University/College/Department]</p>
