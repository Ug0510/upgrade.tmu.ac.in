                                <p class="mb-3">I am delighted to present the panorama of College of Computing Sciences
                                    and Information Technology (CCSIT) in all its hues and colours. The college has been
                                    taking forward the ethos of excellence in the field of computer education under the
                                    meticulous guidance of its committed and experienced faculty and staff members. It
                                    has been flushing out meritorious, qualified and genius students to build a career
                                    in ever expanding IT industry for fifteen years. The college nurtures them with the
                                    quality and etiquettes to face challenges in their future contribution and
                                    endeavours to society and industry. CCSIT is dedicated to provide globally competent
                                    IT Professionals to play instrumental role in the development of society.</p>
                                <p class="mb-3">We, at CCSIT, nurture the students so that they can develop a versatile
                                    personality and become responsible citizens of our nation. We provide ample scope,
                                    opportunities and facilities for the all-round development of personality and
                                    leadership qualities of the students through various academic, cultural, literary,
                                    sports, social and club activities.</p>
                                <p class="mb-3">students through various academic, cultural, literary, sports, social
                                    and club activities. A student is expected to reflect under all circumstances proper
                                    respect for order, morality and rights of others and a sense of personal honour
                                    required for being good citizen. We are desirous that the students of CCSIT become
                                    icons in their respective disciplines.</p>
                                <p class="mb-3"> We firmly believe that students are like clay which can be given
                                    desired shape by experienced craftsman in the form of a teacher. Our endeavour is to
                                    create a pool of talented professionals possessing knowledge, ability and more
                                    importantly, the attitude and resilience to deliver both at regional as well as
                                    global level.</p>

                                <p class="mb-3">At CCSIT, we have been grooming our students with great care, ensuring
                                    that the best available inputs and the latest technology have gone into the process.
                                    Our thrust is to provide highest standards of education in Information Technology
                                    and enabling our students to achieve professional competence in their chosen fields.
                                    We believe in learning to explore new realms of wisdom. Students, at CCSIT, enjoy
                                    all academic and other activities enormously and therefore they demonstrate a high
                                    level of creativity, innovation and a spirit of teamwork. The academic atmosphere in
                                    the college is so conducive that it helps them bring out their talents, develop
                                    their personalities and improve their performance which has in turn led CCSIT alumni
                                    reach up to very senior levels in top companies all over the world.</p>
                                <p class="mb-3">A balanced academic regimen equips students with professional and
                                    personal skills to excel in the sector whichever they chose to work for. In
                                    addition, it enables them to adapt various challenging situations with ease and
                                    confidence. There is no doubt in my mind that they will surpass all expectations
                                    when it comes to fulfil their organizational objectives. The Institute has a track
                                    record of industrial interaction and has recently taken up innovative steps to
                                    encourage and enrich its interactions so that students are trained in a setting that
                                    recognizes the real needs of the field, and use a more practical and applied
                                    approach. CCSIT broad bases its curriculum continuously to cater the needs of the
                                    technological requirements and developments. The institute upgrades its
                                    laboratories, machines and workshops, accessories, software, hardware and other
                                    infrastructure on regular basis to provide the best facilities to its students.</p>
                                <p class="mb-3">I wish all success for the budding software professionals in their quest
                                    for personal as well as national growth.</p>
