                        <p style="text-align:justify; margin:0 10px!important;">The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 recognizes that higher education plays an extremely important role in promoting human as well as societal well-being and in developing India as envisioned in its Constitution - a democratic, just, socially conscious, cultured, and humane nation upholding liberty, equality, fraternity, and justice for all. It notes that “given the 21st - century requirements,
                            quality higher education must aim to develop good, thoughtful, well-rounded, and creative individuals”. Further, it also recommends that “the undergraduate degree will be of either 3 or 4-year duration, with multiple exit options within this period, with appropriate certifications, e.g., a UG certificate after completing 1 year in a discipline or field including vocational and professional areas, or a UG diploma after 2 years of study, or a bachelor’s degree after a 3-year programme. The 4- year multidisciplinary bachelor’s programme, however, shall be the preferred option since it allows the opportunity to experience the full range of holistic and multidisciplinary education in addition to a focus on the chosen major and minors as per the choices of the student”.</p>
