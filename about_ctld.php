                            Here’s a hint, it’s not the grades, instead it’s the personality traits. Companies seeking talent don’t just swipe left on an individual because of low domain scores or grades instead they reject individuals majorly due to the lack of basic aptitudes, life skills, soft skills and Social skills.<br>
                            As per the research by one of the world’s top University, 88% of a candidate’s selection is based on Soft skills and only 12% weighs on domain knowledge in an interview at hotshot corporates and other dream companies.<br>

                            Hence, realising the importance of these skills, Teerthanker Mahaveer University (TMU) introduced new training department which will develop essential basic aptitude skillset in students and faculty members, thus forming <strong>Centre for Teaching Learning and Development (CTLD).</strong><br>
                            CTLD focuses on developing quantitative ability, reasoning ability, verbal ability and developing the personality of the students by encouraging and nurturing their soft skills, so as to be productive to meet the demands of the employers and clearing the placement interview which will pave the way to their dream company. These training programmes also upgrade the students' social and professional skills which are required for their future workspace.
