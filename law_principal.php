                    <br>In the college of Law and Legal Studies, we want to contribute to every student’s success. Legal education has changed drastically over the past ten years in terms of what needs to be taught to meet the needs of the legal market. As litigation is no more centric on legal education, there is a huge challenge for our faculty members to produce lawyers who can go beyond the traditional practice of law. Implementing traditional curricula is not sufficient. Our law college broadens its academic horizon by introducing new legal disciplines preparing our students for the expanding and challenging market. In addition, we train our students in the research skills necessary for today’s practice. Our faculty members deeply care about the success of our students. They are always ready to provide academic and other support needed. We prepare our students to serve their clients with excellence. I welcome you to the College of Law and Legal Studies and be part of future legal education which is professionally and intellectually rewarding.
