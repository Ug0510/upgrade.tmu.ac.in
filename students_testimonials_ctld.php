One time, I had lost my confidence, but Jasmine Ma'am (Trainer) helped me out, and I started gaining the confidence that helped me in my Technical Interview. There was a time I couldn't solve Maths; I feared my company interviews wouldn't go well due to it, but Tarun Sir taught me so well that I understood the concepts, and now I love to solve the Aptitude set. I am immensely thankful to all the CTLD Department members & the University for establishing such a department for the students. They helped me in all ways by providing online lectures, guidance with full dedication and personalized attention.
